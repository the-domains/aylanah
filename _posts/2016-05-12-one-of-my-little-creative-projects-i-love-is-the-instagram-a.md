We participate in weekly themed parties. This weekend is Wrestlemania. Ivan is going to be a Mexican luchador by the name of Bam Bam Flaco. (Which makes me laugh, because he is NOT flaco!) This is the first image I created for the party. "

One of my little creative projects I love is the Instagram account I have created for my cat Ivan. Cats and the Internet...isn't that what it's all about? We participate in weekly themed parties. This weekend is Wrestlemania. Ivan is going to be a Mexican luchador by the name of Bam Bam Flaco. (Which makes me laugh, because he is NOT flaco!) This is the first image I created for the party.
